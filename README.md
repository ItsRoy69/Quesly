Quesly is the name of the community web app developed with the ardent focus of solving a problem. When users post questions, there is a good chance that another member of the community will answer the question, and that answer will be there for anyone else who thinks up the same question. Online communities can get crowded with members who are eager to help others. Quesly is developed with vision of connecting the users.

It is created with using React.js as the client side and Express.js , Node.js on the server side with using MongoDB as the Database and all API's are created manually with Express.js. Socket.io was used
